MittProjekt

This project contains various random files that have very little purpose. They were all created for educational purposes.

USAGE: This project has almost no use. Feel free to look at the files if you please. The java file can be run to print out "hello world" if you so wish.

CREDITS: This project was created solely by Emily Inns, though much of the code was copied from my lecturer Arasto.

License: Everything in this project is free to use. Go nuts bro
